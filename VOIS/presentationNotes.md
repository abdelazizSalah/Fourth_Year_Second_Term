# Notes
1. Let me disscuss our motivation, when Scrum was firstly inventend by Jeff sutherland, and Kenn Schwaber in the 
early of 19's, their main goal was to replace the waterfall methodology. 
and they divided the project into sprints. 
in the begining of each sprint, we must have a long meeting, to discuss the tasks we would do during this sprint
what are the estimated time for each task, how diffcult this task is, and who is going to do this task. 
this process is a little bit time consuming, and prone to errors. 
so the proposed solution aims to address these challenges, and automates this process, from the begining of taking tasks, till delivering and reviewing it.
